# Bevy Block Builder

A simple block-building demo created with the [Bevy Engine](https://bevyengine.org/) and the [bevy_rapier3d](https://crates.io/crates/bevy_rapier3d) physics plugin. This project demonstrates basic 3D scene setup, physics-based object spawning, and a modular code structure following a professional Bevy pattern.

**Camera Controls**: Move the camera with the WASD keys and zoom in/out with the Q and E keys.
